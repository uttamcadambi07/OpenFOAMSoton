This is used to demonstrate the working of checkMesh. 

Run the bash script to check the mesh quality.

I have deliberately increased the aspect ratio of the cells. This is to demomstrate the use of foamToVTK utility that can help visualize the bad cells.

Please ensure that the OpenFOAM environment is sourced before running the bash script.
