We will look at the post processing through controlDict file in this. 

There are five different quantities that are demonstrated. They are:
1. wall shear stress
2. yPlus
3. Reynolds stress tensor
4. force coefficients

Please source the OpenFOAM environment before running the bash script. The postProcessed utilities are stored in the time directories. 

They are also stored in the postProcessing directory under the respective postProcess command name.
