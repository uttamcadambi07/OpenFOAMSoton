This is used to demonstrate the working of cfMesh. 

There are three settings:
1. The most basic one
2. The selective refinement
3. The boundary layer

Use the runCfMesh.sh (by typing ./runCfMesh in the terminal) and pick the case of your choice.

Please ensure that the OpenFOAM environment is sourced before running the bash script.
