We will look at three post processing commands in this directory. 
1. Wall shear stress
2. yPlus
3. Reynolds stress 

Please source the OpenFOAM environment before running the bash script. The postProcessed utilities are stored in the time directories. 

They are also stored in the postProcessing directory under the respective postProcess command name.
